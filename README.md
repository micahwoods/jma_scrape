`jma_data_scrape.R` reads data from the [JMA historical weather site](http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/index.php), writes it to a file in a `data` folder, and the `r/charts.R` makes some charts which I described in the [Tokyo Temperature Time Series](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2015/01/a-tokyo-temperature-time-series.html) blog post.
